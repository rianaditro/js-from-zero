# JavaScript Frontend Development Course (React.js)

Welcome to the **JavaScript Frontend Development Course** repository! This course is designed for aspiring web developers looking to learn and master frontend development using **React.js**. The course starts from the basics and gradually progresses through intermediate and advanced topics. You‚Äôll begin with core JavaScript skills and build up to creating fully-functional web applications using React.js.

## üöß Status: Under Development üöß

This repository is currently a work in progress. At this stage, only the **Beginner** level folder has been added, which focuses on foundational JavaScript knowledge necessary for frontend development. More content will be added soon as we progress with the course development.

## üèÅ Goals of the Course

The main objectives of this course are:
1. **Beginner Level**: Cover the basics of JavaScript, including variables, functions, arrays, objects, and DOM manipulation.
2. **Intermediate Level** (Coming Soon): Explore more advanced JavaScript topics like ES6 features, asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, `async/await`), and basic React.js.
3. **Advanced Level** (Coming Soon): Delve into advanced React.js concepts, including hooks, state management (Redux), and API integration.

This course is designed to take learners from **zero to hero**, equipping them with the necessary skills to build production-level frontend applications using **React.js**.

## üìÇ Folder Structure

- `beginner/` - Contains beginner-level JavaScript files and exercises.
- `intermediate/` - *(Coming Soon)*.
- `advanced/` - *(Coming Soon)*.

## üìö Beginner Folder Overview

The `beginner` folder contains JavaScript files that cover the essential topics to get started with frontend development. Each file includes examples, explanations, and exercises to solidify your understanding.

| `variables.js` | Introduction to variables and data types in JavaScript. Covers `var`, `let`, `const`, and data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, etc. | [Variables in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Grammar_and_Types#declaring_variables) |
| `functions.js` | Introduction to functions, parameters, return values, and how to declare and invoke functions. Includes examples of function expressions and arrow functions. | [Functions in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions) |
| `arrays.js` | A guide to arrays in JavaScript. Covers array methods like `push`, `pop`, `map`, `filter`, and more. | [Arrays in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) |
| `objects.js` | Explains how to create and manipulate objects in JavaScript, including object properties, methods, and `this`. | [Objects in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Working_with_Objects) |

## üîÆ Future Additions

- **Intermediate Folder**: Will cover more complex JavaScript concepts such as `async/await`, promises, ES6 features (classes, modules, destructuring), and an introduction to React.js.
- **Advanced Folder**: Will focus on advanced React.js concepts including hooks, state management (Redux), component lifecycles, routing, and performance optimization.
